## Who Are You?
I am the developer, the person who made this. I love to code, and wanted to make something! So I did.
## Why'd you make this?
I got the inspiration from 2 people, **ech0devv**, and **GamerVerse722**. I thought the concept was pretty cool, and decided to make something of it myself. I also made it due to the unpleaseant rise of GoGuardian and others like it. There are multiple loopholes, however. This was targeted specifically at goguardian.
## Whats the code for it?
Easy, its pretty much just this:
~~~ html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <body>
    <iframe src='Your Url Goes Here'>
  </body>
</html>
~~~
## I know, but how did you make this?
That's a secret.
## Are there any other things you are working on?
Well yeah, but those aren't relevant. They are kinda just fun little things. My main focus is on this.
